1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.402
As we came around the roundabout,
that's on the right-hand side

2
00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.871
by gas station and all these
people were gathered around,

3
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:08.041
and as my vehicle came
up, people were really waving us over.

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.744
So, we finished the roundabout and came out
and I got off.

5
00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.279
People were pointing me over
towards the canal.

6
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.482
What's, I don't have an interpreter
with me right now.

7
00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.250
I don't travel with one.

8
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.418
So, you know "what's wrong?"

9
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.986
And people are pointing
down into the water

10
00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.755
and there's this guy who spoke English,

11
00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.024
who came up behind me,
and said, "Girl in the water".

12
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:24.691
"What, you telling me

13
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.428
there's a girl in the ?" And there's nobody
in the water looking for her, right?

14
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.865
There's one guy that's got like dirt
on his pants, up to his knees.

15
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.800
But it...

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.935
There's a girl,
there's a girl in the water.

17
00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.471
So, I jumped in.

18
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.274
I mean, to help. What do you mean. This
girl is in the water, nobody in the water.

19
00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:41.875
So, I jumped in.

20
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.009
My gunner was right behind me

21
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.678
'cause he'd gotten off with
me as well to see what was wrong.

22
00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.715
So, I jumped in the water and
the water is actually up,

23
00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.917
it came up to my chest

24
00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.854
as he jumped in, filthy shit,
filthy, filthy stuff.

25
00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.991
And what it is, it was right beside,

26
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.393
it's like a culvert
that goes under this water, right?

27
00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:04.064
Because I mean, the main road
you go off of it and there's a culvert

28
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:08.001
that goes in, and maybe
100 meters, maybe?

29
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:08.735
No, you know what?

30
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.836
It seemed like that, but it wasn't.

31
00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.971
This can only be about 50, right?

32
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.240
If that, 25.

33
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.279
But it goes underneath
the road and it's got a wide opening.

34
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:23.883
So, the cement, I mean, the top
of the cement actually came up to my chin,

35
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.118
just below.

36
00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.886
That's where the cement is.

37
00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.322
There's no metal grating, right?
It goes down on it.

38
00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.357
And then, of course, it goes under water,
so it narrows down, right.

39
00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.992
so the wide opening in the
narrowed right in.

40
00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.694
So, you know, but just, whatever...

41
00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.662
And the water was all the way up

42
00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.965
to the top of the, of this culvert
that goes in, right?

43
00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.667
So, it's completely submerged.

44
00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.336
So, I'm looking around,

45
00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.372
I'm trying to get the story at the same
time, well, there's a girl in the water.

46
00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.876
So, I start searching with my hands, right,

47
00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.678
bending down in the stuff,
searching with my hands

48
00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.713
'cause I can't feel anything
under the culvert.

49
00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:57.984
And so, I move back to the other direction,
trying to think, maybe this girl is there.

50
00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.186
And I'm looking at this,
and there's nobody there.

51
00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:05.825
And what had happened
was, there's this little girl, was about

52
00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.161
Oh my... I found her, I guess,

53
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:12.132
maybe three, four years old,
and she'd gone to the edge

54
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.433
'cause everybody's playing there, right?

55
00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.667
And there's a little bit of a market
there.

56
00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:20.039
She'd gone to the edge to relieve herself
and her brother, who was with her,

57
00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.041
and the uncle was away.

58
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.078
There's like a little step ditch
that's just before it drops off.

59
00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.479
So, that's where you can stand.

60
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.716
And she had gone there and the brother told

61
00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.719
"So, what are you doing?"
She said : "You go away."

62
00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.854
Alright, "I'm a girl. I got to go
to the washroom, go away."

63
00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:38.358
And when she didn't come back,
he turned around

64
00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.161
and... she wasn't there.

65
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.098
So, she'd lost her balance
and she'd fallen into the water.

66
00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.066
So, that's what we were saying,
she'd fallen in.

67
00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:51.037
And I look up, and the uncle is there,
'cause he's the one taking care of her,

68
00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:53.806
and he's holding a flip flop.
Because she fell in,

69
00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:54.841
but they found her flip flop.

70
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.310
So, that's where they knew where she fell
in. But I'm looking. I'm going

71
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.180
"Maybe she got scared
'cause I can't feel anything."

72
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.714
So, we grabbed a rope.

73
00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.483
My gunner was about to jump in the water
with me.

74
00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.852
I said, "You're not getting in this
water, man, right?

75
00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.921
I'll just, one, is that enough?

76
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.189
You stay there and you stay dry."

77
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.292
My driver stayed up to communicate
the base, trying to get some help.

78
00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:13.560
And I said, I need a fire department.

79
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.062
I need somebody to
help me get the water down.

80
00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.498
We tied a rope to...

81
00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.367
He had a rope

82
00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.636
and I tied a rope to my arm

83
00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:27.207
and I started diving underneath,
to get underneath the culvert.

84
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.107
Reaching out, you know,

85
00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:32.011
holding my breath and reaching out,
trying to see what I can hold and feel.

86
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.347
I couldn't find anything.

87
00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.417
So, I just kept hoping. I was, "well,
maybe she's not there" and we took out,

88
00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.752
you know, our,

89
00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:43.022
the device where, you put it on the ground
to hold up the camouflage netting, right,

90
00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.557
so you can keep it off the vehicle.

91
00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.826
Put a bunch of those together,
and I was putting that through

92
00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.163
to try and see if I, first of all, to see
if it went all the way through,

93
00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.898
and to sort of see if there's any grating.

94
00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.900
And maybe I could move something
and feel if there's anybody.

95
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.603
And I didn't have any weight.
I didn't feel anything.

96
00:03:56.603 --> 00:04:01.040
And if she was there,
I was hoping that she just got scared

97
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.311
and ran away right and we'd,
and I couldn't find her.

98
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:09.082
So, I was there for,
I would say, the first 45 minutes

99
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.251
I was in the water in and out
of the water, going back and forth,

100
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:15.154
trying everything I could, diving back
in, searching again on my hands and knees,

101
00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.889
trying to find, all these people
standing around it.

102
00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.260
Nobody else, nobody else in the f****g
water, with me trying to help.

103
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.829
So, doing all of this,

104
00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.298
I mean, my weapon is, I mean,
my frag[mentation] vest is gone.

105
00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.000
My weapon is still on me.

106
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.002
And I couldn't,

107
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.337
I couldn't find anything.
I'm rambling, sorry.

108
00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.339
It took a lot of time, right?

109
00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.642
And I finally got out, and I'm
just looking around. She's not there.

110
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.945
She must have gotten scared
and ran off and everything's fine.

111
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.180
And part of me is really hoping

112
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.717
that she's not there because, I mean,
just, there's no way she's alive, right?

113
00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:45.885
Not after the first ten minutes.

114
00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.820
And that, that's the thing
that's really scaring me.

115
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.489
The fire engine finally came,
but they couldn't

116
00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.724
get their equipment to work,
to start draining the water.

117
00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.459
So, I got back in the water.

118
00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.030
Because, so, at least, the fire trucks here
were starting getting down.

119
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.833
The only way I'm going to know for sure is
I got to get underneath.

120
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:04.704
I've got to go underneath the road
because I need to know.

121
00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.906
If the girl's in there, you just
can't leave here there, right?

122
00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:07.707
You've got to do something.

123
00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:11.044
So, I was convinced by this point
that she wasn't there because I figured

124
00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.913
I've done everything I can
and there's no way she's underneath.

125
00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:16.549
So, we... so, the fire trucks
finally started pumping out water,

126
00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.850
and I was going back and forth again.

127
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.053
I mean, again,
I'm the only damn guy in the water,

128
00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:23.523
jumping back and forth from the two sides
and we're finally getting down the water.

129
00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.926
And just as we got it down, just enough

130
00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:27.860
on the one side where all

131
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.631
the filth was, that I could see that
there's a bit of light on the other side.

132
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.766
I went over to the other side
and I started crawling underneath

133
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.902
and going on my back,

134
00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:39.472
just so I could keep my nose above
the water, swimming backwards.

135
00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.607
And then it just kept getting a bit lower,
and I was able to at least

136
00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:46.012
keep my head up a little bit as I went
through, crawling in this culvert.

137
00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.148
Oh, and I mean, there's...

138
00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:54.320
the filth and the silt is all underneath
right at the bottom of the circle.

139
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.623
And that's what I'm crawling in
and feeling it.

140
00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:01.327
I can still taste it, right now.

141
00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.229
And she wasn't there.

142
00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.965
I'd gotten all the way down
to the end.

143
00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.936
I had another five,
maybe five meters to go.

144
00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:13.706
And I was calling out to my gunner, Eric,
who had gone from one side to the other.

145
00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.609
God, he was phenomenal.

146
00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:18.211
And he says, "Yeah, I'm still here.

147
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.613
No, no coming out. No, not."

148
00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.149
And I was five meters away
and I put out my hand,

149
00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.520
and she bobbed to the surface.

150
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.356
And she couldn't have been

151
00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:33.459
more than two inches away from when I dove

152
00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.330
first time after her.

153
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.132
And she...

154
00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.501
she had black hair,

155
00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:44.170
and a pink shirt.

156
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.439
Her eyes were closed.

157
00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:52.912
Uh... I couldn't believe that
she was there, so...

158
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.782
I remember
just picking her up and cradling her.

159
00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.617
Zaya came out.

160
00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:01.554
Eric knew that I'd found her
because I said, "Oh shit".

161
00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:05.024
And I just sat on the edge,

162
00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:08.161
I had her and I just broke down.

163
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.997
I mean, it was about two hours late
and I've been in the water for about two

164
00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.533
hours now, straight.

165
00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:19.872
She's about the same age
as my little girl at the time.

166
00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:23.042
- What was the reaction of the locals
after all this?

167
00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.979
- The gas station attendant was,
who was right there,

168
00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.781
he was amazing.

169
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.950
As I stood there
and they'd taken the little girl away,

170
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.320
and I was trying to figure things out, they

171
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.756
Um, I mean, there are people
all around me, and still,

172
00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.592
the crowd was still there and they were
picking the garbage and the feces,

173
00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:43.262
and everything off of me and my uniform,
and he led me away.

174
00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:46.365
And as he's leading me to the gas station,
I mean, I had to take a knee

175
00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.836
and I started to break down
and he shooed everybody away,

176
00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.971
you know, to give me some privacy.

177
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:57.743
And then he took me into his gas station
and he fetched fresh water, and he and his

178
00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.314
men and everybody around him
poured water over me to clean me off.

179
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.983
And I'll always remember that.

180
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.820
And when I went back, just before I left,
he was there.

181
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.090
And he embraced me like a friend.

182
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.195
You know, we shared something.
And there was a woman who came by

183
00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:20.633
and who spoke
to a reporter who was with us

184
00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.636
and asked if I was the soldier
that went in after the little girl.

185
00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:26.405
I don't know if because she was there,
she'd heard about it.

186
00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.976
The only thing that I can think of is,
I mean, it was a horror.

187
00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.577
That's something that I'm
always going to remember,

188
00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.213
and I don't know
if I really dealt with it yet.

189
00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:35.114
And I don't think I've,

190
00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.883
I probably haven't reconciled the fact

191
00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:41.521
that there was good things that came
out of it. But... That the Afghans

192
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:45.791
maybe at least saw, for two hours,

193
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:48.861
a Canadian coalition soldier
that spent time in the water,

194
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.497
with our uniform and our flag,
trying to do something.
